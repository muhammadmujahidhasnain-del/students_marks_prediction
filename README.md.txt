Student Marks Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a simple Linear Regression project that predicts a student's marks based on the number of study hours.  
It uses a small dataset (`student_marks.csv`) and visualizes the best-fit line using **Matplotlib**.

---

 How it Works
1. Loads the dataset using **Pandas**.
2. Trains a **Linear Regression** model using **scikit-learn**.
3. Visualizes the relationship between *study hours* and *marks*.
4. Predicts marks for given input hours.

Predicted Marks for test data: [23.92 43.46]

Enter study hours to predict marks: 3.5
If a student studies 3.5 hours, predicted marks = 38.58
